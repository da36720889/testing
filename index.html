							<p class="justified-text">Traditional time-domain and spectral-domain OCT systems commonly
								employ galvanometric scanners (Galvos) for point-by-point scanning. While effective,
								Galvos introduce mechanical complexity, sinusoidal waveform distortion, and motion
								jitter, all of which limit imaging speed and compromise system stability. To overcome
								these challenges, line-field OCT (LF-OCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative. LF-OCT
								utilizes line-shaped illumination in combination with an area-array detector to capture
								an entire B-scan image within a single camera exposure. This design eliminates the need
								for mechanical beam scanning across the sample surface during B-scan acquisition,
								significantly improving image acquisition speed and robustness against motion artifacts.
								As a result, LF-OCT is particularly well-suited for high-throughput or real-time
								non-destructive inspection applications.</p>

							<p class="justified-text">High-power femtosecond (fs) laser processing has become a powerful
								tool for material modification, enabling micromachining and functionalization at micro-
								to nanoscale precision. However, evaluating laser-induced effects within biological or
								industrial samples remains challenging—conventional inspection techniques are often
								destructive or lack sufficient resolution to capture subtle internal structural changes.
								To address this limitation, we aim to develop a multimodal system that integrates
								femtosecond laser ablation/machining with an optical coherence tomography (OCT) platform
								for real-time, non-invasive evaluation. This approach enables simultaneous processing
								and imaging, facilitating precise monitoring of laser–material interactions and
								structural evolution during fabrication or treatment.</p>

								refractive distortion correction with a multi-view registration framework, combining
								surface contour extraction and Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based alignment. This
								approach effectively restores geometric accuracy, enhances visualization of internal
								tooth structures, and reduces misalignment artifacts. In parallel, we have developed a

								imaging, its performance can be degraded by scattering and refractive index variations.
								To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel OCT-based method that combines
								refractive index compensation with an automated Fourier transform–based registration and
								stitching algorithm. This technique enables accurate alignment and fusion of multiple
								volumetric OCT datasets into complete 3D reconstructions of dental structures. As a
								result, it enhances the visualization of subgingival finish lines and offers a promising

								To address this challenge, we investigate feasibility of HCG-VCSEL as a compact and
